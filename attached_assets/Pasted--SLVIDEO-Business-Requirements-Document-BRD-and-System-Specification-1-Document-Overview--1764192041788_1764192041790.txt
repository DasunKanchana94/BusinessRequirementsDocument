# SLVIDEO Business Requirements Document (BRD) and System Specification

## 1. Document Overview
### 1.1 Purpose
This Business Requirements Document (BRD) outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for SLVIDEO, a SaaS platform designed for creators and consultants to schedule, book, and conduct paid video calls with clients. SLVIDEO streamlines the process of offering virtual consultations by providing scheduling tools, payment processing with escrow-like holds, customizable booking pages, and seamless video integration. It focuses on video call bookings, differentiating from broader platforms like Stan Store by emphasizing real-time scheduling, session management, and dispute resolution.

The platform enables creators to monetize their expertise through free profile setup, while the SaaS owner (Admin) earns a configurable cut from each transaction. Clients benefit from a frictionless booking experience without mandatory accounts.

This document serves as a blueprint for development on Replit, assuming a full-stack web application using technologies like Node.js/Express for the backend, React for the frontend, MongoDB/PostgreSQL for data storage, and integrations for payments and video calls.

### 1.2 Scope
- **In Scope:** User registration/profiles, scheduling, package management, customizable booking widgets, payment processing with holds/refunds, admin dashboard, video call integration, basic analytics, notifications.
- **Out of Scope:** Advanced e-commerce (e.g., physical product sales), in-app chat beyond video, AI transcription of calls, enterprise-level scalability (initially MVP-focused), mobile native apps (web-responsive only).
- **Assumptions:** 
  - Development on Replit implies a monolithic or microservices-light architecture; external services (e.g., Stripe, Google Meet) will be integrated via APIs.
  - Legal compliance (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS) is handled via third-party integrations; basic terms of service will be included.
  - Missed elements from query (e.g., guest client bookings, email notifications, basic analytics) are incorporated for completeness.

### 1.3 Objectives
- **Business:** Generate revenue via transaction fees (e.g., 10-20% cut configurable by Admin). Achieve 100+ creators in first year.
- **User (Creators):** Reduce booking friction; increase earnings through easy scheduling and payments.
- **User (Clients):** Secure, one-click booking and joining.
- **Admin:** Full oversight, low-maintenance operations.

### 1.4 Stakeholders
- **SaaS Owner/Admin:** Platform owner.
- **Creators/Consultants:** Primary users managing profiles and sessions.
- **Clients/Customers:** End-users booking and attending calls.
- **Development Team:** Building on Replit.

### 1.5 Version History
- Version 1.0: Initial draft (November 27, 2025).

## 2. Business Requirements
### 2.1 High-Level Use Cases
1. **Creator Onboarding:** Register, create profile, define packages/schedules.
2. **Client Booking:** Browse packages, select slot, pay (held funds), receive meeting link.
3. **Session Execution:** Creator joins video call; post-session, funds release.
4. **Payment & Revenue:** Admin-defined cut; holds for disputes.
5. **Admin Management:** Monitor creators, handle refunds, configure fees.
6. **Customization:** Creators embed widgets on their sites; access to recorded content (optional upsell).

### 2.2 Revenue Model
